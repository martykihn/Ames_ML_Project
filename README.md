# Ames_ML_Project

This repo contains iPython notebooks related to the Ames Housing Prices dataset and Kaggle competition.

It was done as an assignment (#3) for the New York Academy of Data Science, where I am a part-time student.

This project applies EDA and ML methods to build a model to predict housing price based on 82 features.

There was also a related Plotly Dash proof-of-concept.
